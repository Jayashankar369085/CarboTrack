                    <p>These days, you might be thinking about how to reduce your carbon footprint. It is impossible to miss news about the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels. While the problem is big, little changes you make every day can help contribute to a cleaner, greener future.</p>
                    <p>Before we talk about ways to reduce your carbon footprint, we must first ask, “what is a carbon footprint?” A carbon footprint is the sum of all the byproducts that come from using fossil fuels to manufacture and move goods, build structures for homes and businesses, provide food, and travel.</p>
                    <p>The gasses produced by these activities, namely carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, are called greenhouse gasses because they trap heat in the atmosphere, raising the average temperature of the earth.</p>
                    <p>Reducing your carbon footprint means changing how you approach and participate in activities that produce greenhouse gasses. This guide will show you how.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Drive less: Organize shopping trips to get more done on each outing, walk or bike when distances are shorter, and use public transportation as much as possible.</li>
                        <li>Go easy on the acceleration and brakes: Acceleration burns more fuel, so maintaining a smooth, even speed is more fuel-efficient.</li>
                        <li>Regularly service your car and keep tires properly inflated: Clean oil and belts, and properly inflated tires help your car run efficiently and use less energy.</li>
                        <li>Carpool: Sharing a ride can reduce your carbon footprint significantly.</li>
                        <li>Use cruise control: It helps maintain an even speed and improves fuel efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Cut down on air conditioning: Reduce usage of the most power-intensive appliance in your car.</li>
                        <li>Consider purchasing a hybrid or electric vehicle: They help eliminate the greenhouse gasses that conventional cars produce.</li>
                        <li>Avoid flying if possible: Air travel produces a significant amount of greenhouse gas.</li>
                        <li>If you must, fly nonstop: Taking off and landing burns more jet fuel than cruising at altitude.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Eat less meat and stick with fruits, veggies, grains, and beans: Raising animals requires more energy than growing plants.</li>
                        <li>Choose organic and local foods that are in season: Reduces energy used for transportation and storage.</li>
                        <li>Reduce your food waste: Buying more food than you need and throwing it away wastes resources.</li>

                        <li>Use a low-flow showerhead: Reduces water and energy usage.</li>
                        <li>Look for an ENERGY STAR® symbol when buying new products: ENERGY STAR® appliances are more efficient.</li>
